# Creation-RAG-Azure
Simple Azure RAG vs Non-RAG:
This Python project shows how to implement an AI assistant with or without RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) using Azure OpenAI and Azure Cognitive Search.
It allows the user to dynamically choose whether to include documentary context in their questions to the AI.

What is RAG?
RAG is an approach that combines document search with text generation. It enables a model like GPT to answer a question based solely on a targeted corpus of documentation, instead of its general knowledge.

Features:
‚úÖ Connection to Azure OpenAI with your own deployment

üîç Integration with Azure Cognitive Search to enrich answers with context

üßæ Strict or non-strict RAG mode (document-based response only)

üë§ Command-line interaction for live testing
